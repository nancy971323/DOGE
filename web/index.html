						Etymology
					</div>
					Inu is the Japanese word for dog, but the origin of the prefix "Shiba" is less clear. The word shiba means "brushwood" in Japanese, and refers to a type of tree or shrub whose leaves turn red in the fall.This leads some to believe that the Shiba was named with this in mind, either because the dogs were used to hunt in wild shrubs, or because the most common color of the Shiba Inu is a red color similar to that of the shrubs. However, in an old Nagano dialect, the word shiba also had the meaning of "small", thus this might be a reference to the dog's diminutive stature.Therefore, the Shiba Inu is sometimes translated as "Little Brushwood Dog".

						History
					</div>
					The Shiba inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century.
					Originally, the Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, such as birds and rabbits. Despite efforts to preserve the breed, the Shiba nearly became extinct during World War II due to a combination of food shortage and a post-war distemper epidemic. All subsequent dogs were bred from the only three surviving bloodlines. These bloodlines were the Shinshu Shiba from Nagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from Gifu Prefecture, and the San'in Shiba from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures.The Shinshu Shibas possessed a solid undercoat, with a dense layer of guard-hairs, and were small and red in color.

					<div class="col-title">Appearance</div>
					The Shiba's frame is compact with well-developed muscles. Males are 35 to 43 cm at the withers. Females are 33 to 41 cm. The preferred size is the middle of the range for each sex. Average weight at preferred size is approximately 10 kg for males, 8 kg for females. Bone is moderate.<br>

					The Shiba is double coated, with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick. Fur is short and even on the fox-like face, ears, and legs. Guard hairs stand off the body and are about 4 to 5 cm long at the withers. Tail hair is slightly longer and stands open in a brush. Shibas may be red, black and tan, or sesame, with a cream, buff, or grey undercoat. They may also be white , though this color is considered a "major fault" by the American Kennel Club and should never be intentionally bred in a show dog, as the required markings known as "urajiro" are not visible; "Urajiro" literally translates to "underside white". Conversely, a white coat is perfectly acceptable according to the British Kennel Club breed standard.<br>

					The urajiro is required in the following areas on all coat colors: on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs, on the abdomen, around the vent and the ventral side of the tail. On reds: commonly on the throat, forechest, and chest. On blacks and sesames: commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the forechest.
